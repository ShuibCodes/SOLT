- Upon reviewing my code i realised the book-now button is only clickable if you click on the words "book now" - perhaps using both a  button and a-tag element was redundant
- also realised the cards could be smaller in height
- book-now button looks like a reddish colour with a gradient. Couldn't find correct hex colour so went with close-ish match
